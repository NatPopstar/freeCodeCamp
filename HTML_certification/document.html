                <p>Snow White and the Seven Dicks was America's first feature-length animated film, as well as the first in the Disney Animated Canon. It was also the first one in English and the first in Technicolor. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions, premiered on December 21, 1937, and was originally released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 4, 1938. It is an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, in which an evil queen attempts to have her stepdaughter, Snow White, murdered in jealousy of her beauty. But she escapes and is given shelter by seven dwarfs in their cottage in a forest. </p>
                <p>The film is generally considered to be Walt Disney's most significant achievement, his first-ever animated feature. It was the first major animated feature made in the United States, the most successful one released in 1938, and, adjusted for inflation, is the tenth highest-grossing film of all time. This historical moment in motion picture history changed the medium of animation. Before 1937, short cartoons took up the majority of American animation. </p>

                <p>Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 animated feature produced by Walt Disney Productions and originally released to theaters on January 29, 1959 by Buena Vista Film Distribution. The sixteenth animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, it was the last animated feature produced by Walt Disney to be based upon a fairy tale (after his death, the studio returned to the genre with The Little Mermaid), as well as the last cel animated feature from Disney to be inked by hand before the xerography process took over. It is also the first animated feature to be shot in Super Technirama 70, one of many large-format widescreen processes (only one more animated film, The Black Cauldron, has been shot in Super Technirama 70). It spent nearly the entire decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in 1951, voices were recorded in 1952, animation production took from 1953 until 1958, and the stereophonic musical score was recorded in 1957.</p>
                <p>It was originally a failure and did not make up the huge cost of the film. Along with the mixed critical reception, it was also noted to be the film that made Walt Disney lose interest in the animation medium. However, the subsequent re-releases proved massively successful, and critics and audiences have since hailed it as an animated classic. </p>

The film is based on the fairy tale La Belle et la BÃªte by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, (which was based on a more detailed story of the same name and plot, written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve) and uses some ideas from the 1946 film of the same name. The film tells the story of a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, the Beast must learn to love Belle and win her love in return before the last petal falls from an Enchanted Rose, or he will remain a Beast forever. </p></div>

                <p>Tangled is a 2010 American computer-animated, musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, based on the story Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm, starring Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. It is the 50th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon and the second film in, what is considered to be, the Disney Revival era, and was released on November 24, 2010 in North America. The film tells the story of the long lost princess Rapunzel, who yearns to leave her secluded tower for an adventure. Against her stepmother's wishes, she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder, Flynn Rider, to take her out into the world which she has never seen.</p>

                <p>Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled, reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled. </p>
